## GPT-Powered Features

### Text Summarization

Automatically generate concise summaries of your notes, articles, or any text content.

**How to use:**

1. Open a note or import content (text, PDF, webpage)
2. Click the "Summarize" button in the toolbar
3. Select the desired summary length (short, medium, long)
4. The AI will generate a summary that captures the main points

**Example:**

```
Original text: [Long paragraph about machine learning concepts...]
Summary: Machine learning is a subset of AI that uses algorithms to learn from data. The main types are supervised learning (using labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through environment interaction).
```

### Key Points Extraction

**Example:**

```
Key Points:
1. Machine learning algorithms learn from data without explicit programming
2. Supervised learning requires labeled training data
3. Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data
4. Reinforcement learning uses rewards and penalties
5. Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers

4. The relationship strength is indicated by a percentage

**Example:**

```
Current note: "Neural Networks Basics"
Related notes:
- Deep Learning Architectures (92% related)
- Activation Functions (85% related)
- Backpropagation Algorithm (82% related)
```

### Note to Quiz Conversion

Convert your notes into quizzes for active recall practice.

**How to use:**

1. Open a note
2. Click the "Create Quiz" button
