# AI-Powered IDEATION ENGINE (Ideater v1.0)

A complete thinking partner that expands your coding idea from a spark into full architecture with visual and interactive tools.

## Overview

Ideater is an AI-powered ideation engine that helps developers transform their initial ideas into comprehensive project architectures. It provides a structured workflow that guides users through the ideation process, from refining their initial concept to generating detailed implementation plans.

## Features

### 🧠 1. Idea Expander
- Refined Idea Statement
- 3 Value Propositions
- 5 Unique Selling Points
- Competitor Comparison Table
- Feature Prioritization Matrix (using RICE or MoSCoW model)

### 🧱 2. Architecture & Tech Suggestion Bot
- Frontend stack suggestion (React/Tailwind/etc)
- Backend stack suggestion (Node/FastAPI/Django)
- Database design (relational vs NoSQL)
- Hosting/CI/CD/DevOps overview
- Code repo structure + modularization plan

### 🔀 3. Flowchart & UX Ideation View
- Interactive Flowchart: Pages, actions, states
- Sequence Diagrams (e.g., login → dashboard → quiz module)
- State Machine Diagrams for complex logic
- Component Diagram (for frontend/backend division)
- Editable via drag-drop canvas or natural language

### ✍️ 4. Pseudo-Code + Task Breakdown
- Module-wise pseudocode
- API route mapping
- User stories (JIRA format)
- Suggested file structure
- List of functions to implement

### 📦 5. Auto-MVP Generator
- MVP Checklist
- What to skip vs. what to keep
- Priority features and fallback logic
- One-click generation of boilerplate repo (GitHub ready)

### 🧪 6. Testing and Debug Plan Generator
- Unit test structure
- Test scenarios for each module
- Mock API generators
- Common edge cases checklist
- Auto-generate test data

### 📈 7. Growth & Future Roadmap Assistant
- Feature timeline for next 3–6 months
- Scalability plan
- AI integration roadmap (e.g., add GPT-based Q&A later)
- Monetization options if needed

### 🎨 8. AI Whiteboard Collaboration
Multi-agent brainstorm with roles:
- 💬 PM: Product ideas
- 🧠 AI Architect: Code structure
- 🔍 Tester: Bugs & issues
- 📊 Analyst: Use-case reasoning

## Bonus Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 💬 Prompt-Driven Flowcharting | Write: "Show flow of e-commerce checkout" → Get full visual |
| 🧩 Feature Pack Generator | Say "Add AI to this" → It generates AI use-cases + backend logic |
| 🛠️ Tech Comparator | Choose between Firebase vs Supabase, Django vs FastAPI with pros/cons |
| 🧭 Decision Tree Generator | Explore "What if?" decision branches in your feature ideas |
| 🎯 AI Code Strategy Coach | Get tips like: "Don't use recursion here, it breaks at scale." |
| 🧠 ML Module Planner | For AI apps: Suggest preprocessing steps, model choices, evaluation metrics |
| 💡 What-If Scenarios | Ask: "What if I go mobile-only?" or "What if this scales to 10K users?" |
| 🧬 Pattern Matcher | Match your idea to known software design patterns (Observer, Factory, etc.) |
| 🪄 Backend Auto-Mocker | Generate mock APIs + dummy data for UI dev |
| 📁 App Skeleton Pack | Export full directory with: routes, controllers, utils, readme |

## Output Modes

- Interactive Canvas (flowcharts + whiteboard + mind maps)
- Doc Generator (PDF/Markdown spec with diagrams and pseudocode)
- GitHub Repo Auto-Bootstrapper
- Notion Integration (roadmap + documentation auto-sync)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+ (for interactive canvas)
